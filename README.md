Hi, great to virtually meet you!  I’m Sean O'Connor, a senior studying Computer Science at Pomona College and a former Software Engineering intern at Indeed.  **I'll be graduating in May 2022 and am currently recruiting for New Grad roles.**  You can check out my [resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oapostrophe/oapostrophe/main/Sean%20OConnor%20Resume.pdf), [portfolio](https://oapostrophe.github.io/projects), [technical blog](https://oapostrophe.github.io/index.html), and find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oapostrophe/).  I'd also love to chat about any of my projects, my experience as a nontraditional student in CS, or whatever--feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:swoconnor2@gmail.com).  Thank you!
