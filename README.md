Hi, great to virtually meet you!  Iâ€™m Sean O'Connor, a senior studying Computer Science at Pomona College and a former Software Engineering intern at Indeed.  I'll be graduating in May 2022 and am currently searching for a New Grad position.  You can read more [about me](https://oapostrophe.github.io/about), check out my [technical blog](https://oapostrophe.github.io/index.html), and find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oapostrophe/).  I'd love to chat about any of my projects, my experience as a nontraditional student in CS, or anything else--feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:swoconnor2@gmail.com).  Thank you!
